## Before you start

Please complete the following steps before getting started if you have not downloaded and configured Git. If you have already completed these steps from course 1, please clone this repo and skip to the Instructions section.

### Download Git

Note, if you are on Windows or Linux, you will need to install Git.  If you do not have git installed, please do so: 

Windows ->  https://git-scm.com/download/win

Linux   ->  https://git-scm.com/download/linux

### Configure git with RStudio 

In the console, run the following: 
```r
install.packages("usethis")

usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Your name", 
  user.email = "Email associated with your GitHub account"
 )
```
Please make sure that you replace "YourName" with your actual name, and "Email associated with your GitHub account" with your email used for your GitHub account. 

### Create and authenticate your personal access token 

In the console, run the following to geneate your personal access token (PAT) 

```r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

Next, run the following and paste your PAT in:

```r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

## Instructions

This final project consists of an exploratory data analysis and write up
of results you discover. The data sets you will be working with can be found in the data folder. Your write up, in index.qmd, will explore (at least) two questions.

## Description

**Inflation in the US**

<img align="right" src="images/inflation.png" width="300" height="180" />

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines inflation as follows:

> Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption in an economy over a period of time.
>
> The main measure of inflation is the annual inflation rate which is the movement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from one month/period to the same month/period of the previous year expressed as percentage over time.
>
> Source: [OECD CPI FAQ](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/consumerpriceindices-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaqs.htm#1)

CPI is broken down into 12 divisions such as food, housing, health, etc.

The data you will need to explore US inflation are spread across two files:

-   `us-inflation.csv`: Annual inflation rate for the US for 12 CPI divisions. Each division is identified by an ID number.
-   `cpi-divisions.xlsx`: A "lookup table" of CPI division ID numbers and their descriptions.

A data table for each dataset can be seen below: 

`us-inflation`

| variable    | description                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `country`    | location data; all values "United States"|
| `cpi_division_id`    | numerical value to represent cpi division|
| `2011` | annual inflation percentage for the year 2011 by cpi division|
| `2012` | annual inflation percentage for the year 2012 by cpi division|
| `...` | ...|
| `2021` | annual inflation percentage for the year 2021 by cpi division|

`cpi-divisions.xlsx`

| variable    | description                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`    | numerical value to represent cpi division|
| `description`    | description of the cpi value|
