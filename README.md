## Before you start

Please complete the following steps before getting started if you have not downloaded and configured Git. If you have already completed these steps from course 1, please clone this repo and skip to the Instructions section.

### Download Git

Note, if you are on Windows or Linux, you will need to install Git.  If you do not have git installed, please do so: 

Windows ->  https://git-scm.com/download/win

Linux   ->  https://git-scm.com/download/linux

### Configure git with RStudio 

In the console, run the following: 
```r
install.packages("usethis")

usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Your name", 
  user.email = "Email associated with your GitHub account"
 )
```
Please make sure that you replace "YourName" with your actual name, and "Email associated with your GitHub account" with your email used for your GitHub account. 

### Create and authenticate your personal access token 

In the console, run the following to geneate your personal access token (PAT) 

```r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

Next, run the following and paste your PAT in:

```r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

## Instructions

This final project consists of an exploratory data analysis and write up
of results you discover. The data sets you will be working with can be found in the data folder. Your write up, in index.qmd, will explore (at least) two questions.

## Description

**Inflation in the US**

<img align="right" src="images/inflation.png" width="300" height="180" />

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines inflation as follows:

> Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption in an economy over a period of time.
>
> The main measure of inflation is the annual inflation rate which is the movement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from one month/period to the same month/period of the previous year expressed as percentage over time.
>
> Source: [OECD CPI FAQ](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/consumerpriceindices-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaqs.htm#1)

CPI is broken down into 12 divisions such as food, housing, health, etc.

The data you will need to explore US inflation are spread across two files:

-   `us-inflation.csv`: Annual inflation rate for the US for 12 CPI divisions. Each division is identified by an ID number.
-   `cpi-divisions.xlsx`: A "lookup table" of CPI division ID numbers and their descriptions.

A data table for each dataset can be seen below: 

`us-inflation`

| variable    | description                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `country`    | location data; all values "United States"|
| `cpi_division_id`    | numerical value to represent cpi division|
| `2011` | annual inflation percentage for the year 2011 by cpi division|
| `2012` | annual inflation percentage for the year 2012 by cpi division|
| `...` | ...|
| `2021` | annual inflation percentage for the year 2021 by cpi division|

`cpi-divisions.xlsx`

| variable    | description                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`    | numerical value to represent cpi division|
| `description`    | description of the cpi value|

## Research Questions 

You are tasked to use these data to produce the following: 

1) Calculate the minimum and maximum annuel inflation percentage for each cpi division. 

2) Recreate a plot of annual inflation vs. year for these divisions. Then, in a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of inflation rates in the US over the last decade.

## Displaying code

Depending on the purpose of the project, it may be advantageous to either show or hide all of your code in your rendered document. To hide all of your code, set `echo: false` in your YAML. If you want to display your code, set `echo: true`.   
 
 
## Citations 

When working on your project, you may want to include outside sources. When doing so, we need to make sure these sources are properly cited. In order to do so, we need to create a .bib file and specify it in your index.qmd's YAML heading. Your project files include a references.bib txt file. This is where you will put bibtex entries. An example of an entry to be referenced can be seen below: 

```
@article{Cetinkaya2020,
	title        = {A Fresh Look at Introductory Data Science},
	author       = {Cetinkaya, Mine and Ellison, Victoria},
	year         = 2020,
	month        = {08},
	journal      = {Journal of Statistics Education},
	volume       = 29,
	pages        = {1--27},
	doi          = {10.1080/10691898.2020.1804497}
}
```
In this entry above, `Cetinkaya2020` is the citation identifier. The default way to cite an entry in your text is with this syntax: [@citation-identifier].

To automatically generate a references section with your entries, the path to the .bib file needs to be specified in your YAML with bibliography: references.bib. This has been done for you. 


<details>
  <summary>RQ2 Hint (Reading in data)</summary>
The top of the cpi-divisions dataset has a note from the researcher. We don't want to include this in the data set. See https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html for how to skip lines when reading in data from excel. Skip the first line. 
   
</details>

<details>
  <summary>RQ2 Hint (Joining)</summary>
Start by using your new dataset from question 1 and joining it with the cpi-divisions dataset. Think critically about what variable is the same across both datasets, and use this as the "key".  

</details>

<details>
  <summary>RQ2 Hint (Subset CPIs)</summary>
To filter the joined dataset by only the IDs of CPI divisions in the final plot, create a vector using `c`. Then filter your joined data set by using the `filter()` function and the `%in%` operator. 
  </details>

<details>
  <summary>RQ2 Hint (Legend)</summary>
If your legend has labels that are too long, you can try moving the legend to the bottom and stack the labels vertically. Hint: The legend.position and legend.direction arguments of the theme() functions will be useful.

  ```
ggplot(...) +
  ... +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom", 
    legend.direction = "vertical"
  )
  ```

<details>
  <summary>Self rubric</summary>

- Check your calculations:
For id 1, minimum annual inflation is equal to -1.32; max is equal to 4.80
For id 2, minimum annual inflation is equal to 1.68; max is equal to 4.46
etc.

- Self assess the graph you made compared to the graph you are trying to recreate. Take note of details such as:
Title and subtitle
Axes labels
Legend position
Color scheme
Categories of cpi division

   </details> 

## Challenge

Using these data, come up with a third research question, add it to your written report, and investigate!
